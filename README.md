## To get this up and running you will need to set-up a venv(Virtual Environment). You can start <a href="http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/" target="_blank">here for that</a>

#### TO activate your `venv` inside your virtual environment run `. bin/activate`

The code has been documented fairly well IMO, The more I add on to it, the more I will document :)
